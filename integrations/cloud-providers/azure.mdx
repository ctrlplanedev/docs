## Resource Provider

The Azure resource provider syncs resources from your Azure subscriptions into Ctrlplane.

### Managed Provider

With some initial configuration, our managed provider will sync your Azure resources for you.

To sync your Azure resources, you'll need:

1. An Azure subscription ID
2. The tenant ID of your Azure subscription
3. Permission to consent to our Azure service principal for that tenant
