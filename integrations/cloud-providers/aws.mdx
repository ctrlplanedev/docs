## Compute Scanner

The AWS Compute Scanner is a tool that scans AWS accounts for new instances and
creates resources for them automatically.

Currently, the AWS Compute Scanner supports importing the following resources:

- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service Clusters (EKS)
- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

## Resource Provider

### Managed AWS Compute Scanner

The managed AWS Compute Scanner is built into the Ctrlplane solution. Each
workspace will be assigned an AWS IAM role when the managed provider is enabled
for that workspace.

You must provide this IAM role with the required permissions to access the
resources in the AWS accounts that you want it to scan.

After the integration is enabled, you can add a new provider, select the Managed
Provider, and add all the roles in your aws account you would like it to assume and
it will scan the resources available to those roles. Once you hit submit, you may
need to wait a few minutes while it scans and imports all compute resources.

#### Role Requirements

The Managed AWS Compute Scanner role can be obtained from the provider settings
under **AWS Role** or from the workspace settings integration page after being
enabled.

The role that you want assumed in your account must have the following permissions
policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["eks:*", "ec2:*"],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

The role also requires a trust policy that allows the
`arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/ctrlplane-<workspace>` role to assume it:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/ctrlplane-<workspace>"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Self-Hosted Ctrlplane

For more information on how to configure the integration for a self-hosted
Ctrlplane instance, see the [AWS self-hosted documentation](/self-hosted/config/integrations/aws).
