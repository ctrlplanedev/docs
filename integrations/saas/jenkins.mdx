## Introduction

The Ctrlplane Jenkins integration allows you to trigger Jenkins pipeline jobs 
directly from Ctrlplane Deployments. This plugin installs a component within your 
Jenkins instance that acts as a Ctrlplane "Job Agent", periodically polling your 
Ctrlplane workspace for pending jobs assigned to it.

## Architecture & Air-Gapped Environments

This polling design has a key advantage for security and network configuration:

*   **Egress Only:** The Jenkins instance only needs outbound (egress) network
    access to reach the Ctrlplane API URL you configure.
*   **No Ingress Required:** Ctrlplane *never* needs to initiate a connection
    *into* your Jenkins instance. This means Jenkins can run in a restricted or
    air-gapped network environment, provided it has a route to communicate
    outwards to the Ctrlplane API. No inbound firewall rules or network
    exposures are necessary for Jenkins related to this plugin.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A running Jenkins instance (version 2.426.3 or newer recommended).
*   A Ctrlplane account and workspace.

### Installation

1.  **Download:** Obtain the latest plugin release (`ctrlplane-plugin.hpi`) from 
    the [plugin's GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ctrlplanedev/jenkins-plugin/releases).
2.  **Upload:** Navigate to your Jenkins instance: **Manage Jenkins** -> 
    **Plugins** -> **Advanced settings** tab.
3.  **Deploy:** Under the **Deploy Plugin** section (or **Upload Plugin** in 
    newer Jenkins versions), click **Choose File**, select the downloaded 
    `ctrlplane-plugin.hpi` file, and click **Deploy**.
4.  **Restart Safely:** Jenkins needs to be restarted for the plugin to become 
    active.
    *   **Recommended:** Check the box **"Restart Jenkins when installation is 
        complete and no jobs are running"** if available during the upload 
        process.
    *   **Manual Restart:** Alternatively, go to **Manage Jenkins**, click 
        **"Prepare for Shutdown"** to allow running jobs to complete, and then 
        manually restart the Jenkins service when it's safe.

### Configuration (Global Jenkins Settings)

Once Jenkins restarts with the plugin installed, you need to configure it to 
connect to your Ctrlplane workspace:

1.  Navigate to **Manage Jenkins** -> **System**.
2.  Scroll down to find the **Ctrlplane Plugin** section.
3.  Fill in the following fields:
    *   **API URL:** The base URL of your Ctrlplane API endpoint 
        (e.g., `https://app.ctrlplane.dev`).
    *   **API Key:** An API key generated within your Ctrlplane 
        workspace with permissions to interact with jobs and agents.
    *   **Agent ID:** A unique name to identify *this specific Jenkins 
        instance* within Ctrlplane (e.g., `jenkins-agent`). This 
        name will appear in Ctrlplane when selecting a Job Agent.
    *   **Agent Workspace ID:** The UUID of the Ctrlplane Workspace this Jenkins 
        agent should belong to. Navigate to your Ctrlplane workspace settings 
        (Workspace Name > Workspace Settings > General) and copy the Workspace UUID to your clipboard.
        The URL will look like: `https://app.ctrlplane.dev/{workspace}/settings/workspace/general`
    *   **Polling Interval (seconds):** The frequency (in seconds) at which the 
        Jenkins Job Agent will poll the Ctrlplane API for new jobs.

4.  Click **Save**.

### Linking Ctrlplane Deployment to Jenkins Agent

After configuring and saving the global settings:

1.  **Agent Registration:** The plugin's poller will automatically attempt to 
    register this Jenkins instance as a Job Agent with your Ctrlplane workspace 
    using the details you provided.
2.  **Verify Agent in Ctrlplane:** Navigate to your Ctrlplane workspace UI, 
    usually under a section for Job Agents. The URL might look like 
    `http://{CTRLPLANE_URL}/{WORKSPACE_ID}/job-agents`. You should see the 
    **Agent Name** you configured listed there.
3.  **Configure Ctrlplane Deployment:**
    *   Go to the specific Deployment in Ctrlplane that you want to trigger 
        Jenkins jobs from (e.g., 
        `http://{CTRLPLANE_URL}/{WORKSPACE_ID}/systems/{SYSTEM_NAME}/deployments/{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}/workflow`).
    *   In the Deployment's workflow configuration, find the **Job Agent** 
        setting. Select the **Agent Name** of your Jenkins instance from the 
        dropdown list.
    *   Configure the **Job URL Path**. This is crucial. It tells the plugin 
        *which specific Jenkins job* to trigger. The format must be the full 
        path from the Jenkins root URL, including all `/job/` segments for 
        folders or multibranch pipelines.
        *   **Example (Freestyle/Pipeline Job):** If your Jenkins job URL is 
            `http://myjenkins.com:8080/job/MySimpleJob/`, the Job URL Path would 
            be `/job/MySimpleJob/`.
        *   **Example (Folder/Multibranch):** If your Jenkins job URL is 
            `http://myjenkins.com:8080/job/MyOrg/job/MyRepo/job/main/`, the Job 
            URL Path would be `/job/MyOrg/job/MyRepo/job/main/`.
    *   Save the Deployment configuration in Ctrlplane.

## Pipeline Usage

When a Ctrlplane Deployment configured with your Jenkins Job Agent and Job URL 
Path is triggered, the plugin will:

1.  Detect the pending job via polling.
2.  Trigger the specified Jenkins pipeline job.
3.  Automatically inject the following parameters into the Jenkins job:
    *   `JOB_ID`: The UUID of the triggering Ctrlplane job.
4.  Report the job status back to Ctrlplane.

### Accessing Job Details in Jenkinsfile

Your Jenkins pipeline can use the injected `JOB_ID` parameter to fetch more 
details about the Ctrlplane job using the custom pipeline step `ctrlplaneGetJob` 
provided by this plugin. This step uses the API URL and Key configured globally 
in Jenkins, so you don't need to manage credentials within the pipeline itself 
for this purpose.

```groovy
// example.Jenkinsfile
import groovy.json.JsonOutput // Keep for pretty printing

pipeline {
    agent any

    parameters {
        // JOB_ID is the only parameter needed now, passed by the plugin trigger
        string(name: 'JOB_ID', defaultValue: '', description: 'Ctrlplane Job ID passed by the plugin')
    }

    stages {
        stage('Fetch Ctrlplane Job Details') { // Stage name can be anything
            steps {
                script {
                    if (!params.JOB_ID) {
                        error 'JOB_ID parameter is required'
                    }

                    echo "Fetching details for Job ID: ${params.JOB_ID}"

                    // Call the custom step provided by the plugin
                    // Jenkins maps 'ctrlplaneGetJob' to your CtrlplaneGetJobStep class
                    // The step accesses global config for API URL and Key internally
                    def jobDetails = ctrlplaneGetJob jobId: params.JOB_ID

                    // If the step failed (e.g., API error, config missing),
                    // it throws AbortException, failing the pipeline.
                    // So, if we reach here, it was successful.

                    echo "-----------------------------------------"
                    echo "Successfully fetched job details:"
                    echo JsonOutput.prettyPrint(JsonOutput.toJson(jobDetails))
                    echo "-----------------------------------------"

                    // Example: Access specific fields from the returned map
                    // echo "Status: ${jobDetails.status}"
                    // echo "Message: ${jobDetails.message}"
                    // if(jobDetails.variables) {
                    //    echo "Specific Variable: ${jobDetails.variables.your_variable_name}" // Replace with actual variable key
                    // }
                    // if(jobDetails.metadata) {
                    //    echo "Metadata Value: ${jobDetails.metadata.your_metadata_key}" // Replace with actual metadata key
                    // }
                }
            }
        }
        // Add other pipeline stages here
    }
}
```

This setup allows Ctrlplane to orchestrate deployments by triggering specific 
Jenkins jobs, while the Jenkins jobs can securely retrieve necessary context 
from Ctrlplane using the provided `JOB_ID` and the custom pipeline step.
