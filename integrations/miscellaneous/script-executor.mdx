## Overview

When configuring a deployment that uses the script executor, you will be
prompted to provide:

1. The script content to execute
2. Any environment variables needed by the script
3. The working directory for script execution (optional)

For example, a script that validates database migrations might look like:

## Usage

To see all available options, run:

```bash
ctrlc sync exec --help
```

Here is a basic example of how to start the job agent:

```bash
ctrlc sync exec \
    --name "my-script-agent" \
    --interval 5s
```

This will register a new job agent with the name `my-script-agent` and check for
new jobs to run every 5 seconds.
