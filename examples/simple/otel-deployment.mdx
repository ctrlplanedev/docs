title: OTEL Deployment
description: |
  At your company, developers can spin up EC2 instances as needed. As the platform team,
  you want to ensure proper observability by automatically deploying OpenTelemetry collectors
  to gather metrics and provide standardized monitoring endpoints.
---

## Requirements

- Automatically deploy OpenTelemetry (OTEL) collectors whenever a new EC2 instance is created
- Track resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory, disk) across all developer instances
- Provide developers with a consistent OTLP endpoint they can use for custom metrics
- Maintain the same deployment configuration in both testing and production environments

## Solution

### 1. Getting EC2 Instances into Ctrlplane

Before deploying OpenTelemetry collectors, EC2 instances must be registered as
Resources in Ctrlplane. These Resources represent the external state of our EC2
instances and require consistent updates as the state of each instance changes.

These are just some of the ways you can get EC2 instances into Ctrlplane.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Using AWS Lambda">
    AWS Lambda can be used to automatically register EC2 instances in Ctrlplane
    whenever they are launched. By setting up a Lambda function triggered by
    CloudWatch Events, you can capture instance launch events and use the
    Ctrlplane API to create or update resources representing these instances.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Using AWS Systems Manager">
  AWS Systems Manager provides a way to manage EC2 instances at scale. By
  integrating Systems Manager with Ctrlplane, you can automatically register
  instances as they are launched. This can be achieved by using Systems Manager
  Run Command to execute scripts that call the Ctrlplane API for resource
  registration.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Using Ctrlplane CLI">
    AWS CloudFormation can be used to define and provision EC2 instances as
    well as register them in Ctrlplane. By including a custom resource in your
    CloudFormation template, you can trigger a Lambda-backed custom resource
    that registers the instance in Ctrlplane upon creation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

In this tutorial, we'll simplify the process by using the Ctrlplane CLI to
manage the state of EC2 instances within Ctrlplane. This approach keeps our
deployment pipeline straightforward and concentrated on the primary task.
However, a limitation is that the pipeline executes every 10 minutes.
Consequently, if a new EC2 instance is launched, it won't trigger a deployment
of OTEL until the next 10-minute cycle.

### 2. Github Deployment Pipeline

```yaml .github/workflows/deploy-otel-agent.yml

            --query "Reservations[0].Instances[0].PublicIpAddress" \
            --output text)

          if [[ "$INSTANCE_IP" == "None" ]]; then
            echo "EC2 instance not found or does not have a public IP"
            exit 1
          fi

          echo "EC2 IP: $INSTANCE_IP"
          echo "ec2_ip=$INSTANCE_IP" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Set up SSH key

          ssh-keyscan -H ${{ env.ec2_ip }} >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

      - name: Deploy OpenTelemetry Agent
        run: |
          ssh ${{ secrets.EC2_USER }}@${{ env.ec2_ip }} << 'EOF'
            set -e

            # Install OpenTelemetry if not installed
            if ! command -v otelcol-contrib &> /dev/null; then
              echo "Installing OpenTelemetry Collector..."
              sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl
              curl -L https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/latest/download/otelcol-contrib-linux-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/otelcol-contrib
              sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/otelcol-contrib
            else
              echo "OpenTelemetry Collector is already installed."
            fi

            # Create systemd service file for OpenTelemetry
            sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/otelcol-contrib.service > /dev/null <<EOT

            [Service]

            # Restart and enable the OpenTelemetry service
            sudo systemctl daemon-reload
            sudo systemctl enable otelcol-contrib
            sudo systemctl restart otelcol-contrib
          EOF
```

### 3. Policy Configuration

## Conclusion

While this example focuses on AWS EC2, the solution can be applied to any
resource type. As long as you can create resources representing your deployment
target in Ctrlplane, you can automate the deployment of OpenTelemetry collectors
and provide standardized monitoring endpoints for your development teams.
