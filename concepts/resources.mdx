title: Resources
description: |
  Resources are the fundamental building blocks of your infrastructure that
  Ctrlplane discovers, manages, and deploys to. A resource represents any cloud or
  infrastructure component your applications run on or interact with.
---

Think of resources as a unified digital representation of your actual
infrastructure - whether it's running in AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or your own
data centers. Resources bridge the gap between your physical/virtual
infrastructure and the software that needs to run on it.

## Key Characteristics

Each resource in Ctrlplane has:

- **Identity**: Unique ID and human-readable name
- **Classification**: Kind (e.g., "ClusterAPI", "VM", "VPC") and version
- **Configuration**: Structured data specific to the resource type
- **Metadata**: Key-value attributes providing additional context
- **Relationships**: Connections to other resources (parent/child, dependencies)

## Resource Types

Ctrlplane manages many types of resources, including:

- **Kubernetes Resources**: Clusters, Namespaces, VClusters
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: VPCs, Subnets, Networks
- **Compute Resources**: Virtual Machines, Container Instances
- **Storage Resources**: Disks, Volumes, Object Storage
- **Custom Resources**: Any infrastructure component you need to track

## How Resources Work

### Discovery and Sync

Ctrlplane automatically discovers resources from your cloud providers through
periodic scans. Once discovered, resources are:

1. Added to your resource inventory
2. Kept in sync with their actual state in your cloud environment
3. Made available as deployment targets

### Resource Variables

You can attach variables to resources to control how they behave during
deployments. These variables can be:

- References to secrets required for access
- Configuration values for deployments
- Environment-specific settings

### Resource Relationships

Resources often have relationships with other resources. For example:

- A VM belongs to a VPC
- A Kubernetes Namespace runs on a Cluster
- A Container Instance uses a Volume

Ctrlplane automatically detects and maintains these relationships, giving you a
complete picture of your infrastructure.

## Why Resources Matter

Resources provide critical benefits:

- **Single Source of Truth**: Comprehensive inventory of all your infrastructure
- **Environment Visibility**: Clear understanding of what's running where
- **Deployment Targeting**: Precise control over where code and configurations
  are deployed
- **Dependency Management**: Awareness of resource connections and requirements
- **Security Boundaries**: Clear separation between environments

## Getting Started with Resources

1. **Connect your cloud providers** to discover resources automatically
2. **Browse your resource inventory** to see what's available
3. **Tag and organize resources** for better visibility
4. **Create deployments** that target specific resources
5. **Track resource health** and relationships through visualizations

Resources are the foundation of Ctrlplane's ability to provide controlled,
observable, and reliable deployments across your entire infrastructure
landscape.
