## Overview

Variables in Ctrlplane allow you to create dynamic and reusable deployment
configurations. By using variables, you can maintain consistent deployment
processes while accommodating differences across environments, resources, and
release channels.

## Variable Types

Ctrlplane supports several types of variables:

- **Environment Variables**: Specific to deployment environments
- **System Variables**: Available across an entire system
- **Resource Variables**: Tied to specific resources
- **Release Variables**: Associated with specific releases
