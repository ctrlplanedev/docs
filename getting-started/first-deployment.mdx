title: Your First Deployment
description: |
  Follow this step-by-step guide to create your first Ctrlplane deployment - a simple "hello world" example that demonstrates the core workflow.
---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you'll need:

- A Ctrlplane Workspace (cloud-hosted or self-hosted)
- The Ctrlplane CLI installed on your local machine

## Step 1: Create a System

A System in Ctrlplane organizes related deployments and environments into logical groups. This structure helps maintain consistency and simplifies management.

To create your first system:

1. In the Ctrlplane UI, click the `+` button in the top left corner
2. Select `New System` from the dropdown menu
3. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., `Hello World Demo`)

## Step 2: Create a Deployment

A Deployment in Ctrlplane represents a complete delivery process for your software or infrastructure. It orchestrates how changes move through your environments.

To create a deployment:

1. Click the `+` button in the top left corner
2. Select `New Deployment` from the dropdown
3. Keep the default option selected for this example
4. Enter a name for your deployment (e.g., `Hello World Deployment`)
5. Click `Create`

## Create a new Resource

Resources in Ctrlplane represent entities that your deployments can target -
these can be infrastructure components like servers and databases, or abstract
concepts like API endpoints and service accounts.

For this tutorial, we'll create a simple resource to represent a server:

1. Click the `+` button in the top left corner to open the menu
2. Select `New Resource` from the dropdown
3. Fill in the following details:

   | Field         | Value                 | Description                                                               |
   | :------------ | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | Name          | `server-a`            | A name for your resource                                                  |
   | Identifier    | `deployment-server-a` | A unique identifier used to reference this resource within your workspace |
   | Kind          | `Server`              | The type of resource being created                                        |
   | Version       | `tutorial/v1`         | The API version for this resource type                                    |
   | Configuration | `{}`                  | Resource-specific configuration options (empty for this tutorial)         |
   | Metadata      | `tutorial = true`     | Additional metadata tags for organizing resources under environments      |

4. Click `Create`

<Note>
  In a real deployment, you would configure additional details like connection
  information and authentication. For this tutorial, we're creating a
  placeholder resource just to demonstrate the workflow.
</Note>

## Configuring Environments

When you create a new system, Ctrlplane automatically creates three default
environments: `QA`, `Staging`, and `Production`. For this simple
example, we'll keep just one environment and delete the others.

To delete environments:

1. Click on the "Environments" tab in the left sidebar under your system
2. For each environment you want to delete:
   - Click on the environment node in the tree view
   - Click on the three dots menu (â‹®) next to the environment name in the top
     left of the drawer
   - Click the `Delete` button from the dropdown
3. Keep only one environment (e.g., `Production`) for this tutorial
4. Click on the `Production` environment node in the tree view
5. Go to the `Resources` tab
6. Here you can create a filter to down to the resources this environment to the
   resource we previously created (see image below).

<Note>
While this tutorial uses a simple single environment setup, real-world
deployments often require more sophisticated environment organization.

For example, in globally distributed systems, you might organize environments by
geographic regions.

</Note>

## Create Job Agent

A Job Agent executes deployment tasks. For this tutorial, we'll create a job
agent to run scripts on your local machine.

1. Download and install the Ctrlplane CLI
2. Get your API key from `<Workspace Name> > Workspace Settings > API Keys`
3. Get your workspace ID from `<Workspace Name> > Workspace Settings > General`
4. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   ctrlc run exec \
       --name tutorial-agent \
       --api-key <your-api-key> \
       --workspace <your-workspace-id>
   ```

   This agent will execute scripts that you configure in the UI when jobs are
   triggered.

Keep this process running as it listens for jobs to execute when deployments are
triggered.

<Note>
  Job Agents execute deployment tasks in your infrastructure. In production, you
  would configure agents with appropriate permissions and access to your
  deployment targets. For this tutorial, we're using a basic configuration.
</Note>

## Connect Agent to Deployment

1. Navigate to your deployment settings page
2. Find the `Job Agents` section
3. Select your job agent from the dropdown
4. Add this simple script:
   ```bash
   echo "Deploying Hello World {{.release.version}} to {{.resource.name}}"
   ```
5. Click `Save`

## Create a Release

1. Go to the release page and click `Create Release`
2. Enter a name like `v1.0.0`
3. Click `Create`

## Deploy the Release

When the release is created, the job agent will be triggered. You should see this output in your job agent terminal:
