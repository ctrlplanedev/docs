## Overview

The Manual Approval Required step allows you to incorporate human approvals
and manual verification into your deployment workflows. When a manual
intervention point is reached, the deployment process pauses and waits for an
explicit approval or rejection from authorized team members.

- **Quality Control**: Add verification steps before critical deployments
- **Compliance**: Ensure proper sign-off for regulated environments
- **Risk Management**: Prevent unauthorized or unreviewed changes
- **Team Collaboration**: Involve relevant stakeholders in the deployment process

## Guide

Assumes you have a deployment pipeline already created. If not, you can create
one by following the [Getting Started](/getting-started/first-deployment) guide.

1. Go to the systems view and click on your environment in the table header.
2. Click `Approval & Governance` in the left sidebar.
3. Toggle `Is approval required` to `Yes`.

Now, when you create a new release, it will pause at the Manual Approval
Required step and wait for you to approve the deployment.
