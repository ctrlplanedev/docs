## Overview

The Manual Intervention Required step allows you to incorporate human approvals and
manual verification into your deployment workflows. When a manual intervention
point is reached, the deployment process pauses and waits for an explicit approval
or rejection from authorized team members.

## Key Benefits

- **Quality Control**: Add verification steps before critical deployments
- **Compliance**: Ensure proper sign-off for regulated environments
- **Risk Management**: Prevent unauthorized or unreviewed changes
- **Team Collaboration**: Involve relevant stakeholders in the deployment process
