title: Rollout & Timing
description: |
  Controls how and when deployments are rolled out to environments, including
  incremental rollouts, scheduling deployments during specific windows, and
  managing release timing to minimize risk and ensure stability during the
  deployment process.
---

## Release Windows

Release windows allow you to control when deployments can be released into an
environment.

## Gradual Rollout

Enabling gradual rollouts will spread deployments evenly out over a given
duration. A default duration of 0ms means that deployments will be rolled out
immediately.

Example values: `10m`, `1h`, `1d`, `1w`

## Deployment Cooldown

Ceployment cooldown is crucial as it ensures a buffer period between releases.
This helps in mitigating risks by allowing time to monitor the impact of the
previous release and address any issues before proceeding with the next one. It
also prevents overwhelming the system with rapid consecutive deployments,
maintaining stability and performance.

- Example values: `5m`, `2h`, `1d`
