Approval Gates require authorization before a release, ensuring:

1. **Compliance**: Meet industry standards.
2. **Quality**: Ensure production-ready releases.
3. **Change Management**: Document and approve changes.
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Prevent unauthorized changes.
5. **Collaboration**: Involve relevant parties.

Approval Gates ensure only approved releases proceed.

## Deployment Validation and Resource Requirements

Ensure consistent deployments by specifying resource requirements in dependent
environments before triggering releases.

- **Risk Mitigation**: Prevent high-failure releases from advancing.
- **Validation**: Validate in less critical environments to reduce errors.
