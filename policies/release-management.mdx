## Release Sequencing

Release sequencing policies determine how Ctrlplane handles pending releases when a new one is triggered. This prevents deployment conflicts and maintains infrastructure stability.

### Available Strategies

- **Cancel Pending Releases**
  - When activated: Immediately cancels any pending releases when a new release is triggered
  - Best for: Environments where only the latest release matters
  - Example use case: Development environments where you want to skip intermediate versions
  
- **Await Pending Releases**
  - When activated: New releases wait for pending releases to complete before starting
  - Best for: Production environments requiring sequential, complete deployments
  - Example use case: Systems with database migrations that must execute in order

### Configuration

Configure release sequencing at the system or environment level:

1. Navigate to System Settings or Environment Settings
2. Select "Release Management" 
3. Choose your preferred strategy
4. Save your changes

### Benefits

- Prevents deployment collisions
- Ensures correct execution order
- Maintains deployment history
- Reduces risk during complex deployments
