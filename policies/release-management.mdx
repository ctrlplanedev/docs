title: Release Management
description: |
  Manages new and pending releases in the deployment pipeline, defining 
  rules to cancel or await pending releases for controlled, 
  conflict-free execution.

## Release Sequencing

Specify whether pending releases should be cancelled or awaited when a new
release is triggered.

- **Cancel**: Stop pending releases.
- **Await**: Wait for pending releases to complete.

This policy ensures orderly release execution, preventing conflicts and ensuring
consistency across environments.
