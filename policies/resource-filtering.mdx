title: Resource Filtering
description: |
  Resource filters define criteria for selecting which resources to
  deploy in an environment.
---

## Filter Levels

Filters can be applied at two levels:

- **Environment** - Applies to all deployments in the environment
- **Deployment** - Applies to a specific deployment only

When both levels are used, only resources matching both filters are deployed.

For best results, prefer environment-level filters and organize your systems and
deployments accordingly.
