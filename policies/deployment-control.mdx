  concurrency, release filtering, and operational constraints to ensure orderly
  processes without resource overload or rule violations.

## Concurrency Control

Limit concurrent jobs in an environment.

1. **Resource Management**: Stage deployments to prevent CI/CD and infrastructure overload.
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Staggered deployments reduce widespread failure risks.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Gradual deployment avoids resource usage spikes.

Applying this policy across environments ensures total job concurrency stays within limits.
