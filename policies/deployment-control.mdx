title: Deployment Control
description: |
  Deployment control policies regulate execution within environments, managing
  concurrency, release filtering, and operational constraints to ensure orderly
  processes without resource overload or rule violations.

## Concurrency Control

Limit concurrent jobs in an environment.

1. **Resource Management**: Stage deployments to prevent CI/CD and infrastructure overload.
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Staggered deployments reduce widespread failure risks.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Gradual deployment avoids resource usage spikes.

Applying this policy across environments ensures total job concurrency stays within limits.

## Deployment Retry

Configure automatic retry attempts for failed deployments.

1. **Resilience**: Automatically retry transient failures without manual
   intervention
2. **Configurable Limits**: Set maximum retry attempts before marking as failed

This helps handle temporary infrastructure issues or external service outages.
