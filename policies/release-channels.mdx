  be deployed to a particular environment.

## Release Channel Policies

Release channel policies define the rules for which releases can be deployed to
specific environments. This ensures that only the appropriate versions of a
deployment are released to the right environments, maintaining stability and
control over the deployment process.

### Common Use Cases

#### Git Commits

When any git commit could be a release:

- Deploying only the `main` branch releases to the production environment to
  ensure stability.
- Allowing any branch to be deployed to the QA environment for comprehensive
  testing and validation.

#### Major Releases

When deploying third party software its common to only want to upgrade to
minor versions. This means that:

- Only minor version updates (e.g., from `1.1` to `1.2`) are automatically
  deployed to environments.
- Major version updates (e.g., from `1.x` to `2.0`) are not automatically
  deployed. This is because such updates may necessitate policy adjustments to
  accommodate releases that need manual oversight.
