description: Terraform module for installing Ctrlplane on Google Kubernetes Engine.

<Warning>
  We recommend using the cloud-native version of
  [Ctrlplane](https://app.ctrlplane.dev) when possible. Current selfhosted
  installation is not stable.

This module creates a resilient and fault-tolerant Ctrlplane installation using
Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) as the computing environment and the following
services for storing data:

- CloudSQL for PostgreSQL
- Memorystore for Redis
- Cloud Storage

## Compatibility

This module is meant for use with Terraform **1.0+** and tested using Terraform **1.5**.

## Usage

There are examples included in the examples folder but simple usage is as
follows:

```hcl
module "ctrlplane" {
  source    = "ctrlplanedev/ctrlplane/google"
  namespace = "ctrlplane"
  domains   = ["<fqdn>"]
}
```

Then perform the following commands on the root folder:

- `terraform init` to get the plugins
- `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan
- `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build
- `terraform destroy` to destroy the built infrastructure
