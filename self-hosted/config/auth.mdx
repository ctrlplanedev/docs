By default, Ctrlplane uses email/password authentication out of the box.

## OpenID Connect (OIDC)

You can configure OIDC authentication using environment variables. This allows
you to integrate with identity providers like Google, GitHub, or any other
OIDC-compliant provider.

### Environment Variables

Configure the following environment variables to set up OIDC authentication:

<ResponseField name="OIDC_ISSUER_URL" type="string" required>
  The URL of your OIDC provider's issuer (e.g. `https://accounts.google.com`)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="OIDC_CLIENT_ID" type="string" required>
  The client ID obtained from your OIDC provider
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET" type="string" required>
  The client secret obtained from your OIDC provider
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="OIDC_CALLBACK_URL" type="string" required>
  The callback URL for your application (e.g.
  `https://your-domain.com/auth/callback`)
</ResponseField>
