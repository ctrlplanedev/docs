This guide will help you set up Google authentication for your Ctrlplane
application.

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account
- A GCP project with the Google+ API enabled

## Setup Steps

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console.
2. Select your project or create a new one.
3. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
4. Click "Create Credentials" and select "OAuth client ID".
5. Choose "Web application" as the application type.
6. Set the authorized redirect URI to
   `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback/google`.
7. Click "Create" to generate your client ID and client secret.

## Configuration

To enable Google authentication, you need to set the following environment
variables:

<ResponseField name="AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID" type="string" required>
  Your Google OAuth client ID obtained from the Google Cloud Console
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="AUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET" type="string" required>
  Your Google OAuth client secret obtained from the Google Cloud Console
</ResponseField>

When these variables are set, Google authentication will be automatically
enabled, and basic authentication will be disabled unless explicitly enabled.

## Usage

Once configured, users will be able to sign in to your Ctrlplane application
using their Google accounts. The authentication flow will redirect users to
Google's login page and then back to your Ctrlplane instance after successful
authentication.
