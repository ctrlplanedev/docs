## Overview

Ctrlplane provides built-in integration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) through
managed IAM roles. This allows workspaces to automatically access and
manage AWS resources without users having to deploy their own job agents.

## How It Works

When enabled, Ctrlplane will:

1. Create IAM roles for each workspace
2. Manage the lifecycle of these IAM roles
3. Handle authentication and authorization to scan AWS resources

## Configuration

Ctrlplane uses standard AWS authentication methods. The application
will automatically detect and use credentials in the following order:

1. Environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
2. AWS credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`)
3. IAM role when running in AWS (e.g. EKS, EC2)
4. Web Identity Federation (for cross-cloud authentication)

### Running in AWS

When running in Amazon Web Services (EKS, EC2, etc.), the application
will automatically use the instance IAM role. No additional configuration
is needed.

### Running Outside AWS

When running outside of AWS, you'll need to configure administrative AWS
credentials that allow Ctrlplane to manage workspace IAM roles in a landing
AWS account. These credentials require specific permissions to create and
manage IAM roles.

<Warning>
  The IAM role or user credentials must have the following permissions: 
  - `iam:CreateRole` 
  - `iam:PutRolePolicy` 
  - `iam:DeleteRole` 
  - `iam:DeleteRolePolicy` 
  - `sts:AssumeRole`
</Warning>

You have several options for providing these credentials to the application:

1. Environment variables:

<RequestExample>

```yaml Helm Chart
global:
  extraEnvs:
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: your-access-key
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: your-secret-key
    AWS_REGION: your-region

```

```yaml Docker Compose
environment:
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: your-access-key
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: your-secret-key
  AWS_REGION: your-region
```

</RequestExample>

2. AWS credentials file:

Create or update `~/.aws/credentials`:

```ini
[default]
aws_access_key_id = your-access-key
aws_secret_access_key = your-secret-key
region = your-region
```

3. Alternative authentication methods:
   - EKS node role (when running in EKS)
   - AWS IAM role with workload identity federation
   - Cross-cloud authentication (supports AWS authentication via GCP/Azure workload identity federation)

Here's the required IAM policy for the administrative role:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iam:CreateRole",
        "iam:PutRolePolicy",
        "iam:DeleteRole",
        "iam:DeleteRolePolicy",
        "sts:AssumeRole"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

For more information about IAM policies, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_actions-list.html).

If you have the administrative credentials configured and are ready to
configure the AWS integration to scan resources in your accounts, see the
[AWS integration guide](/integrations/cloud-providers/aws).
