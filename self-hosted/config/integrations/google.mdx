## Overview

Ctrlplane provides built-in integration with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) through
managed service accounts. This allows workspaces to automatically access and
manage GCP resources without users having to deploy their own job agents.

<Note>
  If you're using the Terraform Module, this will automatically be configured.
</Note>

## How It Works

When enabled, Ctrlplane will:

1. Create a service account for each workspace
2. Manage the lifecycle of these service accounts
3. Handle authentication and authorization to GCP resources

## Configuration

Ctrlplane uses the standard Google Cloud authentication methods. The application
will automatically detect and use credentials in the following order:

1. `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable pointing to a service
   account key file
2. Default service account when running in GCP (e.g. GKE, Compute Engine)
3. Application default credentials from `gcloud auth application-default login`
4. Workload Identity Federation (for AWS, Azure, etc.)

### Running in GCP

When running in Google Cloud Platform (GKE, etc.), the application
will automatically use the default service account. No additional configuration
is needed.

### Running Outside GCP

When running outside of GCP, you have two options:

1. Set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable:

To enable the Google managed agent integration, configure the following
environment variables:

<Warning>
  The service account used for GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS must have the "Service Account
  Admin" and "Service Account Key Admin" IAM roles. These are need to create and
  assume the role of the service accounts created for each workspace.
</Warning>

```yaml Helm Chart
webservice:
  extraEnvs:
    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: /path/to/service-account.json
```

```yaml Docker Compose
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: /path/to/service-account.json
```
