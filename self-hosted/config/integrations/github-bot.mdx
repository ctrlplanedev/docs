## Creating a Github App

<Steps>
  <Step title="On Github, create a new Github App">
    To set this up, navigate to [github.com](https://github.com/) and register a new
    GitHub App.

    - Your GitHub account: https://github.com/settings/apps/new
    - Your GitHub organization:
    `https://github.com/organizations/<your-org>/settings/apps/new`

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Github App">
    Fill out the form as follows:

    | Field           | Value                                                 |
    | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
    | Github App Name | `ctrlplane-{your-instance-name}`                      |
    | Homepage URL    | `<your-instance-url>`                                 |
    | Webhook URL     | `<your-instance-url>/api/github/webhook`              |

    Configure the permissions as follows:
    - Repository
        - `Actions: Read and write` Allows the
        creation of workflow runs associated with your deployments.
        - `Contents: Read only` Allows
        Ctrlplane to detect changes to your `*ctrlplane.yaml` configuration files.
        Read more about [configuration management](../config-files).
    - Organization
        - `Members: Read only` Allows you to
        configure github organizations across your workspaces.
    - Subscribe to Events
        - `Push` Subscribe to push events to
        sync changes to your deployment configurations.
        - `Workflow run` Subscribe to workflow
        run events to sync the status of your distpatched workflows. See
        [Actions Dispatcher](./github/actions-dispatcher) for more information.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the Client Secret">
    Copy or note down the client secret, as it will be used to configure the Github
    App.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate a new private key">
    Generate a new private key, and download the file.
