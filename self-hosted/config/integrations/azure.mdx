## Overview

Ctrlplane provides built-in integration with Azure through Entra app registrations. This allows workspaces to automatically
access and manage Azure resources.

## How It Works

To enable the integration, you'll need to create an Entra app registration for your Ctrlplane instance.

Once created, you can configure a subscription-specific resource provider for each Azure subscription you want to sync.
  
## Configuration

### Creating an Entra app registration

To create an Entra app registration, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Azure portal and select your Azure Active Directory.
2. In the left-hand menu, select `Microsoft Entra ID`.
3. Under the `Manage` dropdown, select `App registrations`.
4. Click `New registration`.
5. Fill in the required fields:
    - Name: Give your app a name, for example, "Ctrlplane".
    - Redirect URI: Set this to `https://<ctrlplane-instance-url>/api/azure/consent` with the platform as `Web`.
    - Supported account types: Select the scope of accounts that can use this app, for example, `Accounts in this organizational directory only` (this is the default and recommended setting).

6. Click `Register`.

<Note>
  You'll need to save the `Application (client) ID` as you'll need it to enable the integration on your instance.
</Note>

### Generate a client secret

Once the app registration is created, you'll need to generate a client secret.

1. Navigate to the app registration you just created.
2. In the left-hand menu, select `Certificates & secrets`.
3. Click `New client secret`.
4. Fill in the required fields:
    - Description: Give your secret a description, for example, "Ctrlplane client secret".
    - Expires: Select the expiration date for your secret, for example, `1 year`.
5. Click `Add`.

<Note>
  You'll need to save the `Client secret` as you'll need it to enable the integration on your instance.
</Note>

<Note>
  Once the client secret is expired, you'll need to generate a new one and update the integration on your instance.
