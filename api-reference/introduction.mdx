  Ctrlplane API reference

OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) is a standardized specification for
describing REST APIs. It provides a way to document API's endpoints,
request/response formats, authentication methods, and other details in a
machine-readable format.

The OpenAPI specification makes it easier to:

- Auto-generate API client libraries
- Enable API discovery and exploration

Our OpenAPI specification contains detailed information about all available
Ctrlplane API endpoints, including:

- Available HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.)
- Request parameters and body schemas
- Response formats and status codes
- Authentication requirements
- Examples and descriptions
